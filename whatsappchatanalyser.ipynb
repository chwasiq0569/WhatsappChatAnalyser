However, due to resurgence of the COVID cases in the twin cities followed by instructions of the Federal government to close down all educational institutions for academic activities, we are impelled to get back to online mode of instructions for all programs till April 11, 2021. We shall open the campus for academic activities as and when the government decides.\n",

We already have burden of 3 projects that have been given to us just before 3-4 days before exams and we have to submit them before viva. We have to prepare for paper, projects and viva's.

      "زندگی میں بار بار مسائل اور مصائب آتے ہیں- ایسا ہر مرد اور عورت کے ساتھ پیش آتا ہے- اس سے کس طرح کامیابی سے نپٹا جا ئے- اس کا جواب قرآن کی سوره نمبر 2 کی ایک آیت میں ملتا ہے- اس کا ترجمہ یہ ہے : \" اور ہم تم کو آزمائیں گے کچجہ ڈر اور بهوک سے اور مالوں اور جانووں اور پهلوں کی کمی سے- اور ثابت قدم رینے والوں کو خوش خبری دے دو جن کا حال یہ ہے کہ جب ان کو کوئی مصیبت پہنچتی ہے تو وه کہتے ہیں : ہم اللہ کے لئے ہیں اور ہم اسی کی طرف لوٹنے والے ہیں\"-(البقره 156-155)\n",
      "\n",
      "مسائل اور مصائب کے وقت کوئی شخص ذہنی تناو کا شکار کیوں ہوتا ہے اس کا سبب یہ ہے کہ وه اس کو ایک ایسی چیز سمجهتا ہے جس کو نہ ہونا چاہئے تها- آدمی اگر یہ سمجهہ لے کہ جو کچهہ پیش آیا ہے وه خود فطرت کے قانون کے تحت پیش آیا ہے تو وه کبهی ذہنی تناو کا شکار نہ ہو- مثلا اگر آندهی اور بارش آئے تو وه بهی انسان کے لئے مسئلہ پیدا کرتی ہے مگر آندهی اور بارش کے وقت آدمی ذہنی تناو کا شکار نہیں ہوتا- وه اس کو فطرت کے قانون کے تحت ہونے والا واقعہ سمجهتا ہے اور معتدل انداز میں اس کا سامنا کرتا ہے-\n",
      "\n",
      "یہی معاملہ زندگی کے مسائل اور مصائب کا بهی ہے- یہ چیزیں خالق کے تخلیقی منصوبہ کے تحت پیش آتی ہیں- وه انسان کے لیے زحمت میں رحمت کی حیثیت رکهتی ہیں-  آدمی اگر پیش آنے والے مصائب کو اس حیثیت سے لے تو وه کبهی ذہنی تناو کا شکار نہ ہو-\n",
      "\n",
      "مصائب یا مسائل کا سامنا کرنے کے دو طریقے ہیں- ایک صبر کا طریقہ اور دوسرا، بے صبری کا طریقہ- بے صبری کا طریقہ، دوسرے لفظوں میں، منفی ردعمل کا طریقہ ہے-  اس کے برعکس صبر کا طریقہ مثبت ردعمل کا طریقہ- ذہنی تناو ہمیشہ بے صبری کا نتیجہ ہوتا ہے- اس کے مقابلہ میں صبر کا طریقہ آدمی کو ذہنی تناو کا شکار ہونے سے بچا لیتا ہے- \n",
      "\n",
      "اس دنیا میں ہر آدمی قانون خداوندی، بالفاظ دیگر قانون فطرت کے تابع ہے- وه اپنے آغاز میں بهی اس قانوں کے ماتحت ہے اور اپنے آخر میں بهی اسی قانون کے ماتحت- ایسی حالت میں حقیقت پسندی کا طریقہ یہ ہے کہ کوئی مرد عورت جب کسی مسئلہ سے دوچار ہو تو وه معتدل انداز میں اس کا سامنا کرے- وه اس کو اپنے حق میں خیر سمجهہ کر اس کو قبول کرے-\n",
      "\n",
      "اس آیت میں مصیبتوں کا مقصد ابتلاء (ولنبلونکم) بتایا گیا ہے- ابتلاء کے معنی امتحان یا آزمائش ہیں- انسانی زندگی میں اس قسم کے امتحان کا مقصد یہ ہے کہ اس کو حوادث کے درمیان تربیت دے کر زیاده بہتر انسان بنایا جائے- حوادث کسی آدمی کے لیے ترقی کا زینہ ہیں- حوادث کے ذریعہ آدمی کا ذہن بیدار ہوتا ہے- حوادث کے ذریعہ آدمی کے اندر پختگی آتی ہے- حوادث آدمی کو متحرک کرنے کا ذریعہ ہیں- حوادث آدمی کے لیے زندگی کے سفر میں مہمیز کا کام کرتے ہیں- حوادث کے بغیر آدمی نامکمل ہے- یہ حوادث ہی ہیں جو آدمی کی شخصیت کو مکمل شخصیت بناتے ہیں-\n",
      "\n",
      "اس سے معلوم ہوا کہ حوادث کا صحیح مقابلہ یہ نہیں ہے کہ اپنے اندر ذہنی عمل کو سپریس کر دیا جائے یا اس کو دبانے کی کوشش کی جائے- بہت سے لوگ یہی طریقہ اختیار کرتے ہیں- وه سگریٹ یا شراب کے ذریعہ اس کو بهلانے کی کوشش کرتے ہیں- وه مخصوص ورزشوں کے ذریعہ اپنے اندر ذہنی عمل کو معطل کر دینا چاہتے ہیں- وه حقیقی زندگی سے فرار کا کوئی طریقہ تلاش کرتے ہیں- وه میڈیٹیشن (Meditation) کے ذریعہ اپنے ذہن کو ایک ایسی حالت میں لے جاتے ہیں جس کو ذہنی تخدیر (Intellectual anaesthesia) کہا جا سکتا ہے- اس قسم کے تمام طریقے فطرت کے خلاف ہیں اور جو چیز فطرت کے خلاف ہو وه کبهی انسان کے لیے مفید نہیں ہو سکتی-\n",

      "2/9/23, 5:05 PM - Awais uni: I was serving in embassy of Pakistan Ankara in 2005 as a Minister, when Pakistan was rocked by the deadly earth quake.\n",
      "I had hardly settled in the office on that fateful day when the telephone rang. The DG from the prime misters office was on the otherside. He said PM Erdovan wants to inform the govt of Pakistan that the first Turkish aircraft  loaded with relief goods is on the tarmac, ready to takeoff. Permission may kindly be granted to enable it to fly to Islamabad. I was overwhelmed with emotions. The PM himself was there giving these instructions when Pakistan Television had hardly started giving the details of initial destruction of Margalla towers. This is how the Turks reacted and this is how Erdovan took over the charge of one of the greatest relief efforts in Pakistans history.\n",
      "Men women and children, soldiers, teachers, students, doctors, nurses, shopkeepers, businessmen, artists, politicians, religious leaders, scholars, all lined up to join the relief efforts which continued for months with  same zeal and  fervour. \n",
      "Tear filled children and women were  a normal sight but there were many men who broke down with overwhelming emotions. This was Turkey and so was the reflection of heartfelt love.\n",
      "An extremely graceful elderly lady came limping along with a young man carrying a very large bag, the type our cricketers usually travel with. It was filled with sweaters and scarfs which she had hand knitted with wool herself. I had to excuse myself for a while because i was unable to control my emotions. \n",
      "This was Turkey and that is how they love us.\n",
      "The bank account opened by the embassy at Ankara on instructions of the government of Pakistan, posted 4 million dollars within a few weeks. The one at Istanbul had double the amount .\n",
      "Ladies and school girls deposited their gold ornaments informing us that ' we have heard from our grand parents, how the women of sub continent had collected their gold ornaments and sent them to assist the Khilafat movement in Turkey prior to the great war. This is a small token of gratitude from us'. \n",
      "( These gold ornaments were displayed in a  box in our presidency for quite a while. Dont know where that is now).\n",
      "Banner and Pakistan flags, many as tall as six seven story buildings were seen in many cities. Fund raising programs were held on numerous occasions. \n",
      "The entire courtyard area and garages of our embassy were filled to capacity with relief goods. While the first large trailer carrying the relief items was entering Pakistan( by road) , there were large numbers of the same , still being loaded in the Turkish Red-cross premises in Ankara and elsewhere. \n",
      "Turks were the only people who gave their lives in this mammoth relief work. Three Turkish engineers who were supervising relief operations in Muzafarabad were badly burnt when their tent caught fire. They were airlifted back to Ankara on a Turkish air ambulance but most unfortunately, one of them couldn't survive. On our recommendation, the govt of Pakistan graciously conferred high civil awards to all three of them. I visited them regularly in the hospitals. That was all i could do😔. \n",
      "Our official condolence book kept in the embassy was not sufficient for the condolence messages by the visiting Turks. Therefore  we had kept registers to ensure everyone who visits the embassy, is able to ensure his most honoured presence is recorded in the history books   of Pak Turk love. Stories are numerous, enough to fill books. \n",
      "This was Turkey my dear Pakistanis. \n",
      "Time to repay our respect and love, has arrived.\n",
      "Visit your Turk friends for condolences, Visit their embassy and other relief work centers. Express your love for that great nation. Join the relief work and donation campaigns in every way possible. Not that they are poor, yes because they deserve our love and affection in this hour of need. \n",
      "Our heart felt prayers for our Turk brothers and sisters. \n",
      "Long live Pak Turk brotherhood.\n",
